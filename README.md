# Project-1-Stage-1
In this project, I have built an app to help users to discover popular and recent movies. With the help of Picasso and TheMovieDw.
IN THIS PROjECT:
    Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
    This Android application allows your user to change sort order via a setting:
        The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated Movies
    And also allows the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
        original title
        movie poster image thumbnail
        A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
        user rating (called vote_average in the api)
        release date


Task Completed:
    Build a UI layout for multiple Activities.
    Launch these Activities via Intent.
    Fetch data from themovieDB API


If User wants to Run/Execute this project, user need to sign up with TheMovieDw. Then get the key from TheMovieDW and put it to correct location in MainActivity file of this project and Run the project.
